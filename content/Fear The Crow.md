This is the first game in development in the new Personal and Friendly Studios roadmap. To see more about that, read [[Where is The Sauk Archive?]]

Creating a game like Quake is something I've always been interested in, but making something like this in an already established engine introduces a ton of focus stealing features that aren't needed for the project. 

This game aims to not only remedy that, but to also act as a fundamental teacher to build experience with so for when the other projects listed in "[[Where is The Sauk Archive?]]", the extra aspects of the engine will act as a super power whether than a hindrance.

I also really just want to learn more about how engines are made, and using something like the [Raylib Library](https://www.raylib.com) really empowers me to build something without having to reinvent the wheel too much. I always hear about the K.I.S.S protocol being applied to game development and sometimes only reinventing what you NEED is the simplest approach. 

so I introduce to you, the [[Phantom Engine]]. An open source engine I am developing around Fear the Crow, catering specifically to it's needs.

Now about the actual game, I am developing this with the help of 3 other people as Friendly Studios.

Myself - Programmer, Lead Developer, Texture Artist, Project Management.
Mark - 3D Artist, Animator, Texture Artist, Designer.
Brett - Infrastructure and DevOps

Mark has been helping a ton with [The Sauk Archive]([[Where is The Sauk Archive?]]) by creating extremely polished assets with a retro, ps1 aesthetic. 

Brett and I met as coworkers at a previous employers, he is a wizard with basically everything and he's maintaining our internal version control, CI/DI, Internal AI Training and putting out fires whenever our Proxmox cluster decides to combust.

To follow the development of the project, feel free to view our Trello and GitHub Repository. Links Below.
