Welcome to my site! Think of this as a form of virtual garden, in which all of my digital seeds grow.

Is it a portfolio? Is it a Blog? Is it a Knowledge Base? Maybe.

In reality I've been needing a place to put some of my thoughts freely and publicly while keeping it streamlined. I live by my Obsidian vault and being able to publish this for free and securely is key. This entire site you are reading is fully open source and available to view [here](https://github.com/ionthedev/ionthedev.github.io)

This place will essentially act as a public second brain for myself, while showcasing cool things I am working on. So come along for the ride!
