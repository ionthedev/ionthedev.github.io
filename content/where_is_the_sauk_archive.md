The Sauk Archive is currently on a hiatus. Due to changes in my personal and professional life, it is currently on hold.

This allows me to better focus on my family, my studies as well as improving my  as a developer as a whole. The scope of the project was WAY larger than I expected and I really need to pull back a bit in order to improve my skillset. This hiatus allows me to really give the project the true attention to detail it deserves.

So the plan before turning back to The Sauk Archive is to release 4 different games with 4 different tools.

- [Fear the Crow]() - Custom Engine, using C++ and Raylib.
- Unannounced - Godot Engine, using GDscript.
- Unannounced - Unity Engine, using C#.
- Unannounced - Unreal Engine, using Blueprint and C++.
